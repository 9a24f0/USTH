# Asymmetric cryptography
- trap door 1-way func (easy to compute y = f(x), but infeasible to compute x = R(f(y)))
- a key pair: k1 is broadcast to anyone, k2 is secret
- C = k1(M), M = k2(C)

# RSA key generation
- choose p, q: large prime numbers
- choose e relative number to (p-1)(q-1)
- de = 1 mod [(p-1)(q-1)]
- key pairs:
  - public key: (N, e)
  - private key: d
- Encryption: C = M^e mod N
- Decryption: M = C^d mod N
- common used encryption: e = 3 -> M > N^(1/3) to avoid cube root atk -> e = 2^16 + 1

## Example
p = 11, q = 3, e = 3
```
N = pq = 33, (p-1)(q-1) = 20 -> d = 7
```
- key pair: (N, e) = (33, 3); d = 7
- M = 15 -> C = 15^3 mod 33 = 9

(N, e) = (33, 23), M = 5
- N = 33 -> p = 11, q = 3 or vice versa -> N' = 20 -> d = 20 -> C = 5^23 mod 33 = 26
