# Concepts of OO

## Model
- Def'n: simplication of reality
- Why use: we can not fully understand complex sys
- Goal:
  - visualize sys -> easier understand
  - specify struct & behav
  - give guide
  - document decisions

### Principles
- model influence how problem solved
- best model connects to reality (customer might add new requirements)
- no single model is sufficient
- every model has diff lvl of precision

### Approaches
- Procedural modeling
- OO modeling *
- Rule based modeling
- Agent-Oriented modeling
- Model-Driven modeling
- Aspect-Oriented modeling

# OO Modeling
## Object Tech
- Def'n: set of principles + lang + DB + tools
- Strength:
  - provide single paradigm
  - easier arch and code reuse
  - models close to reality
  - provide stability
  - adaptive to change

## Principles
### Abstract
- Def'n: to distinguish entities

### Encapsulation
- Def'n: hide implementation from clients

### Modularity
- Def'n: break sys -> manageable pieces
- Eg: Course registration system -> billing sys, course catalog sys, student manage sys

### Hierarchy
- Elements same level hierarchy shuold has same lvl abstraction
