# View
- Def'n: virtual relation based on result-set of a SELECT statement
- Syntax:
```sql
	CREATE VIEW view_name AS
	SELECT column_name(s)
	FROM table_name
	WHERE condition
```
- Uses:
  - restrict data access
  - hide sensitive data
  - simplify data
  - reuse complex queries

## Types of views
### Virtual
- use in DB
- compute only on-demand - slower at runtime
- always up to date

## Mat views
- used in data warehouse
- pre-computed offline -> faster runtime
- may have stale data

## Modify data of views
mod view -> mod base tables<br>
restrictions:
- view contains JOIN -> can't DELETE rows, only INSERT and UPDATE one table 
- view based on UNION, GROUP BY, DISTINCT -> cant mod
- cant UPDATE text and image columns

WITH CHECK OPTION: check if modify value fit with data in view

# Stored procedure
- Def'n: T-SQL statement that SQL server compiles -> exec plan
- Stored in cache, can be used repeatly, no need recompile
- Param: input, output

## Syntax
```
CREATE PROCEDURE sp_name AS
```

## Types
- System stored procedure
- Local stored procedure

## Executing a SP
- default: `EXEC pr_GetTopProducts`
- with param:
```sql
 By Name:
EXEC pr_GetTopProducts
@StartID = 1, @EndID = 10
 By Position:
EXEC pr_GetTopProducts 1, 10
 Leveraging Default values
EXEC pr_GetTopProducts @EndID=10
```

## Output param
use to send non-recordset info -> client

add OUTPUT after output param

## Advantages
- security
- code reuse, modular programming
- performance
- reduce traffic

# SQL Programming

## Control flow
- WHILE
- IF ELSE
- BEGIN END
- CASE
- WAITFOR
- CONTINUE/BREAK

## Var
- DECLARE @var
- SET @var = value;
- SELECT @price = price FROM titles;

## CASE ... WHEN
```sql
CASE expression
	WHEN ... THEN ...
	WHEN ... THEN ...
	ELSE ...
END
```

## TRY ... CATCH
```sql
BEGIN TRY
	...
END TRY
BEGIN CATCH
	....
END CATCH
```

## WHILE
```sql
WHILE condition
BEGIN
	...
END
```

## Cursor
- pointer: use to revisit the record
```sql
DECLARE cursor_name CURSOR
	FOR select_statement
OPEN cursor_name
FETCH NEXT FROM cursor INTO var_list

WHILE @@FETCH_STATUS = 0
	BEGIN
		...
		FETCH NEXT FROM...
		...

	END

CLOSE cursor_name

DEALLOCATE cursor_name
```

# User defined function
## Syntax
```sql
	CREATE FUNCTION dbo.fn_total(@param1
	datatype)
	RETURNS datatype
	AS
	BEGIN
	DECLARE @localvar datatype2
	--populate @localvar here
	RETURN @localvar
	END
```
## Returned data types
- scalar
- inline table values
- multi-statement table value

## Adv
- greatly simplify select line
- modular programming
- improve reliability of data by reducting number of joins and encapsulating queries
- reduce network traffic
- faster execution

# Trigger
- Def'n: special SP executed auto as part of data modification

## Syntax
```sql
CREATE TRIGGER name
ON table_name
FOR DELETE/INSERT/UPDATE
AS
sql_statement
```
