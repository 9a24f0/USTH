# Inner join
```sql
SELECT *
FROM student A, class B
WHERE A.class_id = B.class_id
```
or
```sql
SELECT *
FROM student A INNER JOIN class B ON A.class_id = B.class_id
```

# Non-inner join
```sql
SELECT A.student_id, B.grade
FROM student A, ranking B
WHERE A.marks >= B.MIN AND A.mark <B.MAX
```

# Outer joins
used if row does not satisfy join condition

## Left outer join
list all element in the left table key col
``` sql
SELECT A.class_name
FROM class A LEFT OUTER JOIN student B
ON A.class_id = B.class_id
```

## Right outer join
list all element in the right table key col
``` sql
SELECT B.class_name
FROM class A LEFT OUTER JOIN student B
ON A.class_id = B.class_id
```

## Full outer join
``` sql
SELECT B.class_name
FROM class A FULL OUTER JOIN student B
ON A.class_id = B.class_id
```

# Disambiguating attr
- what?: 2 attr has same name
- solution: place a relation name and "." in front of an attr

E.g:
```sql
A.class name
```
is different from
```sql
B.class name
```

# SET operators

## Union and union all
`UNION` operator eliminates any duplicated rows while `UNION ALL` still returns

## Intersect

## Diff (`EXCEPT`)

# Aggregate func
- `AVG`
- `COUNT`
- `MAX`
- `MIN`
- `SUM`
- `STDDEV`
- `VARIANCE`

# Grouping
- syntax: `GROUP BY`
- `GROUP BY` column does not have to be in `SELECT` list
- Rules with NULLs:
  - The value NULL is ignored in any aggregation: SUM (A) only sum tuples has value not NULL
  - NULL is treated as an ordinary value when forming groups

# Having
condition for `GROUP BY`<br>

e.g:
```sql
SELECT  department_id, MAX(salary)
FROM    employees
GROUP BY department_id
HAVING  MAX(salary) > 10000;
```
The query above gives the result of departmend id that have max salary > 10000
