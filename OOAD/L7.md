# Objective
- define purpose of Identify design elements & demonstrate where in life cycle it is performed
- analyze

# Purpose
to define architecture

# Steps
## From analysis classes -> design element
- many-to-many mapping
- analysis class maps directly -> design class when it's simple/ represent single logical abstraction
- more complex analysis classes may map to multiple classes/become package/subsystem

## Design package
- configuration units
- reflect user type
- represent existing products & services system use

### tips:
- change in one class -> change in other
- remove class -> impact other
- 2 obj have complex intercommunication
- boundary class might functionally related to particular entity class
- two class are affected by same actor

### package element visibility
- only pub classes can be ref outside the owning package

### package coupling
- 
-
- 

### Subsystem and interface
- subsystem:
- complete encapsulated behav
- represent indipendent capability w clear interface -> reuse pot
- model multiple implementation variants

### identify subsystem
- object collab
- optionality
- UI of system
- actors
- coupling and cohesion: loose coupling, high cohesion
- substitution
- distribution
- volatility

### Candidate subsystem
- analysis classes provide complex service, ultilities; is boundary class
- existing products/external system in design

## Identify inteface

### Steps
- identify set of candidate
- look for similarities btwn interfaces
- define dependencies
- map to subsystem
- define specified behavior
- packaging

### Guideline
- name
- description
- op definition
- documentation

### Convention
start with "i"

## Indentify reuse opportuniites
### steps
- look for similar interfaces
- mod new interfaces -> improve fit
- replace candidate interfaces w existung interfaces
- map candidate subsystem -> existing component

## Update organization
