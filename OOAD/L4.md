# Analysis and Design

## Purpose
- transform requirements -> design of system-to-be
- evolve rough architecture for system
- adapt design -> implementation environment

## Overview of artifacts
- Design model
- arch doc
- data model

## Analysis vs Design
| Analysis               | Design                  |
|------------------------|-------------------------|
| understand the problem | understand the solution |
| idealized design       | opr and attr            |
| behavior               | performance             |
| system structure       | close to real code      |
| func req               | non-func req            |
| small model            | large model             |

Resposibility of class: class must have to do sth
Q: What the different between analysis object and design object

## AnD are not only Top-Donw/Bottom-Up
- From analysis classes, we might top-down-develop to design classes
- From analysis classes, we might want to bottom-up-dev to subsystem
- AnD are mix!

# Archtecture
- Def'n: include set of decisions about the organization of software sys

## The 4+1 view
- logical view: analysist's view ~ ab structure
- implementation view: programmer's view ~ ab software functionality
- process view: system integrator's view ~ ab software non-func
- deployment view: system engineering's view ~ ab physical view: connections, installations,...
- use case: end-user's view: ~ functionality
