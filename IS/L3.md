# Stream vs Block cipher
- block: b-bits at a time
- stream: b-bits but 1 at a time

# Stream cipher
key K of n bits is stretched into a long keystream S<br>
x_i, y_i, s_i \in {0,1}: individual bits of plaintext, ciphertext and keystream
- encription: y_i = x_i XOR s_i 
- decription: x_i = y_i XOR s_i 

## A5/1 cipher
- used in GSM
- majority vote func: m = maj(x,y,z), m = 0 if majority (x,y,z) = 0, else m = 1
- x,y,z steps when x,y,z = m
- A5/1: m = maj(x8, y10, z10)
X steps then xi = x(i-1)

## RC4 keystream generation
- used in software (SSL, WEP,....)
- Key: N bytes 1 <= N <= 256
