```
- high lvl des: functions with constraints
- RDB schema: describe of DB des (tables, relations,...)
- RDBMS: specific DB design

# How to express high lvl design
- first and oldest: Entity Relationship Diagram - ERD (focus on this course)
- recent trend: UML 

# E/R model and ERD

## Entity sets
- Entity set = collection of similar entities
- Attribute = property of entity set

## E/R Diagrams
- Entity set = rectangle
- Attribute = oval
Example:
```
        +------+                        +------+
        | name |                        | manf |
        +------+                        +------+
            \                           /
             \                         /
              \_____                  /
                    \                /              (name and manf should be oval)
                    +-------+       /
                    | Beers |______/
                    +-------+
```

## Relationships
- connects 2+ entity sets
- shape: diamond

### Multiplicities of binary relationship

#### many to many
e.g: *Sells* between **Bars** and **Beers**
- bar sells many beers, beers is sold by many bars

#### many to one
e.g: *fav* between **drinker** and **beer**
- drinker has 1 most fav beer
- a kind of beer can be fav by multilpe drinkers

#### one to one
e.g: *best seller* **manf** and **beer**
- beer cant be made by 1+ manf, and no manf can have more that 1 best-seller(this feels wrong)

## Representing "Multiplicity"
- many-one: arrow entering "one" side
- one-one: arrow entering both sides

**Rounded-arrow**: exactly one

## Attr on relationships
use when attribute are not belong to 1 entity set only but rather both linked with an relationship

## Roles
- entity appeart more than once in a relationship
- label on the edges between relationship

## Subclasses
- special case
- represent as a triangle

## Weak
Entity set E is weak if we need to follow 1+ relationships from E to identify entities uniquely

Example:
- `name` should be key for football player, but there might be 2 with the same name
- `number` should not be the key, since players on 2 teams could have same number
Thus, `name` along with `number` should be the key.

Rules:
- have 1 or more relationship to support entity sets
    - not every many-one relationship from weak entity set need supporting.
    - supporting relationships must have a rounded arrows.
- the key include attr of entity set + supporting entity sets

## Framework for E/R
- desgin is a serious business.
- Need a DB, but dont know what inside
- Efficient method: Sketch key componenets

# Design technique
## avoid redundancy
waste space and raise inconsistency (change one and forget the other)

## limit use of weak entity sets
- beginners often doube anything could be a key -> they make all entity sets weak, supported by all other entity sets
- in reality, we usually create unik ID for ea entity sets

## dont use entity sets for the work of attr
- entity sets should have more than 1 attribute
- or it is "many" in many-one/many-many relationship
