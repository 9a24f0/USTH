# Rings

(R, +.) such that
```
	f: R x R -> R	f(a,b) = a + b
	g: R x R -> R	g(a,b) = a.b
```
- (R,+) must be an abelian
- (R, .) is associative: (ab)c = a(bc) for abc $\in$ R
- (R, .) is distributive: (a+b)c = ab + bc

if multiplication is also commutative

e.g 1:
(Z, +, .))
* (Z, +) is abelian
* (Z, .) is associative
* (Z, .) is distributive with respect to "+"

e.g 2:
(N, +, .) is not a ring (under add, isnt a group)

e.g 4:
any polynomial function is a ring

proof: polynomial func: R -> R, f(x) = a_0x^0 + ....

* f(x) is abelian under +
* associativity under .
* distributivity under . with respect to +

e.g 5:
2 x 2 matrices with entries in R form a ring under the usual operation of matrix addition and multiplication.

- (M, +) is abelian (M = {a, b; c, d})
  - (M, +) is associative (M1+M2)+M3 = M1+(M2+M3)
  - Identity: M = {0 0; 0 0}
  - Inverse: {-a, -b; -c, -d}
  - Commutative: M1+M2 = M2+M1
- (M1.M2)M3 = M1(M2.M3) is EASY

# Ring homomorphisms
f: R -> S satify:
- f(a+b) = f(a) + f(b)
- f(ab) = f(a) . f(b)

# Ring isomorphism
f: R -> S, if f is homo and bijective, it's isomorphic

# Subring
S is subset of R, S is subring if
- S \diff \empt
- ab $\in$ S $\forall$ a,b $\in$ S
- a-b $\in$ S $\forall$ a,b $\in$ S

e.g1:
Z and Q are subring of R

# Fields
(R,+,*) is a field if: 
- both operation are commutative and associative
- contain iden elements: 0 for add, 1 for mul
- contain inverse elements: -a for add, 1/a for mul
- mul distributes over addition:
(a+b)c = ac + bc
a(b+c) = ab + ac

e.g: 
N*, Z*, Q*, R*, C* are fields.

# Proposition 1
F be a field
- add iden is unique
- add inverse aussi unik
- mul iden aussi unik
- mul inverse aussi unik
