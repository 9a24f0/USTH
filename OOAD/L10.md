# Concurrency
Eg: parallel roads require little coordination, intersections require carefull coordinations, ...
## Why we need?
- software might need to resoind to random external events
- perfoming task in parallel -> improve performance when using CPUs
- control system can be enhanced
## What we need?
- system must provide for multiple threads of control
- common concurrency mech: multiprocessing, multitasking, app-based solution

# Run-time architecture
## Analyze concurrency requirements
Concurrency requirements are driven by
- system must be distributed
- system is event-driven
- computation of algo
- parallel execution supported by the environment

Concurrency requirements are ranked in terms of importance to resolve conflicts

## Iden process and threads
- process
- thread

### Modeling processes
- active classes (class dia), objects (interaction dia)
- dependencies = process relationship

## Iden process lifecycles
- single-process arch
- multi-process arch

## Map processes -> implementation
Considerations:
- process coupling
- performance requirements
- system process and thread limits
- existing threads and processes
- IPC resource availability

## Distribute model elements among processes
