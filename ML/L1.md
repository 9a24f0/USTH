# AI
- is a sub field of CS

## Fields
- Weak AI: aiming building sys bahave like human
- Strong: not only behave, but also think like human

## Unsupervised learning
- no exact output
- data is not labeled
- target: group similar inputs into same group/cluster
## Supervised learning
- output is known
- data is labeled
- target: regression or classification
## Semi-supervised
- combine both label & unlabel data
## Reinforcement learning
- discover output that yield most reward

# Linear regression
- x: feature
- y: respones
- (x, y): one training data
- (x_i, y_i): ith training data
- output y is a linear func of input : y = ax + b
- cost func: evaluate the model: e = 1/2(h(x)-y)^2, e must be small

## Multiple input regression
y = h(x) = theta^T * x
