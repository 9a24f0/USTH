# Why study DB?

- Shift from `computation` to `information`
- Relate to most of CS: info sys, OS, languages, AI, multimedia
- Datasets increasing in diversity & volume: Digital lib, interactive video, Human Genome project, EOS project

# Database application example
- Contact list
- Item description on Amazon

# Basic definition
- Data: fact recorded and have implicit meaning
- _Note: Data != information, the data must be processed to get info_
- Database:
  - data existing long T
  - to store, orginize structure, create/modify/query data
- Database Management System:
  - DBMS + additional software

# Sample database

# Main characteristic:
- self describe: DB should be able to describe
- Isolate `program` vs `data`. E.g: iphone 6 have old data, buying iphone 7 and having old data should works!
- Data abstraction: end-user just need to know how to access data, dont need to know how to manipulate them
- Support multiple view of data: same data but diff user should see data diff. __E.g:__ manager and human resource office know every emplyee's salary. While employee only know about their only!

# DB Technology's Trends
- DBMS is become smaller and cheaper!
- System is becoming bigger and bigger!

# DBMS
a software package designed to maintain& utilize DB.

## Database User
- DB administrator: authorizing acess, controlling it use
- DB desinger: define architect inside DB
- End-user: use data for queries
- Others: DBMS designers + implemeters, tool dev, operator + maintenance person

## Typical DBMS functionalities
- Defined database: structures/ constraints
- Construct/ Load DB on 2nd storage
- Manipulating database
- Concurrent Processing & Sharing: support multiple users to use da data

# Database language
The most common DB model today: table with tuple as rows and attr as col

## DML
- Comp language used by comp programs/db users to `retrieve`, `insert`, `delete`, `update`
- Most use: SQL

## DDL (Data - Definition Language)
- Computer lang for defining data structures
- initial: CREAT, DROP, ALTER

# Common in DBMS industry
- IBM: DB2
- Mcs: SQL server
- Oracle: 9i
- Sybase: SQL Anywhere

# Advantages
- Provide backup and recovery
- provide multiple interfaces to diff classes of users (E.g: diff interfaces btwn boss & employee)
- represent complex rela btwn data
- enforce integrity constraints on db
- drwing inferences & actions using rules

# Disad
- High initial investment
- Over head for providing generality security, concurrency control, recovery, and integrity functions.
