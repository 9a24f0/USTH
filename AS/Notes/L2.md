# Cartesian Products
Let A = {1,2,3}, B = {x, y}
A x B = {(1,x), (2,x), (3,x), (1,y), (2,y), (3,y)}

- If A x A x A ... -> A^n

- Mapping (or func f $\in$ A x B) satisfy:
        If a $\in$ A, exist unique B $\in$ B

        We write f: A -> B

- Eg:
        A = {1,2,3}
        B = {a,b,c}
        f = {(1,a), (1,b), (2,c), (3,a)} is not mapping bc 1 maps to a and b

# Mapping

## Injective (one to one)

- Def: never maps distincts element in A to same element in B

- Eg:   A = {1,2,3}
        B = {b, c, d}
        f = {(1,d), (2,b), (3,d), (4,d)} is not injective because d got mapped twice

## Surjective (onto)

- Def: every elements in Y got mapped by at least 1 element in X

- Eg: 	X = {1,2,3,4}
	Y = {d,b,c,a}
	f = {(1,d), (2,b), (3,c), (4,c)} is not surjective bc a is not mapped

## Compostion
Let f(x) = x^2, g(x) = 2x+5
(f composition g)(x) = f(g(x)) = (2x + 5)^2
(g composition f)(x) = g(f(x)) = 2x^2 + 5

Eg: 	f(p/q) = (p+1)/(p-2)
	f(1/1) = f(1) = -2
	f(3/3) = f(1) = 4
	-> f is !mapping

	f(p/q) = p/(p+q)
	f(kp/kq) = kp/k(p+q) = p/(p+q) with k diff 0
	However! if p/q = -1 -> f(p/q) does not exist. Thus, f is !mapping
