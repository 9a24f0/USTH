# Homomorphism (multiple form)

map f: G -> H between (G, *) and (H, o) preserves the operations of the structures.

f(g1*g2) = f(g1) o f(g2)

- **E.g**: 
\phi: (Z, +) to (G, .)

\phi(x+y) = \phi(x).\phi(y)

g^(x+y) = g^x.g^y

- **E.g 2**:
f(x) = |x| (R -> R+) is homomorphism under multiplication but not under addition.

- **E.g 3**:
f(x) = \sqrt(x) (R -> R+) is non homomorphism under mul and add

- **E.g 3**:
f(x) = sin(x) (R -> R) is non homomorphism under mul and add

## Kernel
kernel of a group homomorphism (f: G -> H) is the set of elements in G sent to the identity

kernel f = {x: f(x) = e_H}

## Proposition 1
\phi(e_G) = e_H

**proof**: \phi(x) = \phi(x*e_G) = \phi(x) o \phi(e_G)
and: \phi(x) = \phi(x) o e_H

## Proposition 2
f(g)^{-1} = f(g^{-1})

**proof**: f(g) o f(g^{-1}) = f(g*g^{-1}) = f(e_G) = e_H
and: f(g) o f(g^{-1}) = e_H

# Isomorphism (equal structure)
(G, *) and (H, o) are isomorphic
if \phi: G -> H is one-to-one and onto such that: \phi(a*b) = \phi(a) o \phi(b)

\phi: G -> G: **automorphism**

E.g: \phi: (R; +) -> (R+, *)

\phi(x+y) = \phi(x) * \phi(y)

e^{x+y} = e^x + e^y

## Theorem 1
\phi: (G, *) -> (H, o) be isomorphism, then:
- \phi^{-1} : H -> G is an isomorphism
- |G| = |H|
- G is abelian, H is abelian
- G is cyclic, H is cyclic

## Theorem 2
All cyclic group of finite order are isomorphic to Z
