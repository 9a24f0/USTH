# RA Review
## Operation
- <<pi>> (project): select some columns
- <<phi>> (select): select some rows
- <<rho>> (rename): ...
- <<join>> (join): natural join, conditional join

## Key of relation
A set attr A is key of relation R if:
- those attr det all other attr
- no subset of A det all other attr

Other types of key
- Super key: set of col uniquely iden rows
- Key (candidate key): minimal super key
- Primary key: unik, selected from key
- Alternate key: !primary
- Foreign key: refers to PK of another relation

## Normal forms
### Why normalize?
- Data redundancy
- Update abnormally: problem when not updating all necessary rows/cols

### Normal forms
- First: atomic values, unique rows
- Second: Non-prim key attr depends on ALL component of PK
- Third: No non-key attr depends on other
- Boyce-Codd: All det must be super keys <br>
BCNF Condition: If X -> Y, X is __super key__<br>
BCNF is advanced 3NF, different is subtle, but important

## SQL Queries
### CASE WHEN clause
```sql
SELECT
ProductNumber, Category =
CASE ProductLine
WHEN 'R' THEN 'Road'
WHEN 'M' THEN 'Mountain'
WHEN 'T' THEN 'Touring'
WHEN 'S' THEN 'Other sale items'
ELSE 'Not for sale'
END,
Name
FROM Production.Product
ORDER BY ProductNumber;
```
We not update the actual data in the DB, instead we replace it for the output to user

### Subquery
Main query: Which employees have salaries > Abel's salary
Subquery: What's Abel's salary
