# Binary Operations

## Unary operation
Let S be non-empty set. Unary operation maps S -> S
```
    a -> (-a), a -> a/2
```

## Bin operation
*: S x S -> S(a,b) 

E.g: addtion (+) is not a operation in S = {0, 1}
- \* is commutative: a * b = b * a;
- \* is associative: (a * b) * c = a * (b * c)

E.g: subtraction is not a commutative and associative bin operation in N, Z, Q, R and C

E.g: multiplication is commutative and associative bin op in N, Z, Q, R, C but not M_m,n

E.g: (a_1, a_2).(b_1, b_2) = a_1b_1 + a_2b_2
Since we mapping R2 * R2 -> R, this is not bin operation
but (a_1, a_2).(b_1, b_2) = (a_1b_1 , a_2b_2) is both commutative and associative

# Group
Let G be non-empty set, * is bin op in G
(G, *) is a group iff:
- G1 - associative
- G2 - identity element: exist e $\in$ G such a * e = e * a = a
- G3 - inverse element: exist a^(-1): a * a^(-1) = e
- G4 (optional): iff a group is commutative, it is an abelian group

E.g: (Z, +):
- G1: associative, commutative: checked
- G2: identity element: 0
- G3: inverse element: (-a)

E.g: 
- (R, +), (Q, +), (C, +) are groups
- (Q, .), (C, .) are abelian groups, not (Z, .), (R, .)

E.g: M2(R): a set of all 2x2 matrices
(M2(R), +) is an !group

## Proposition 1
The **identity element** in G is unik

Proof: if exist e' is identity element
- e * e' = e'
- e' * e = e
Thus, e = e'

## Proposition 2
The inverse of G is unik

Proof:  g * g' = e = g' * g
        g * g'' = e = g'' * g
        g' = g' * e = g' * (g * g'') = (g' * g) * g'' = e * g'' = g''

## Proposition 3
Let G in group, a,b $\in$ G, then (a * b)^(-1) = b^(-1) * a^(-1)
e = {a * a^(-1)} * {b * b^(-1)} = (a * b) * b^(-1) * a^(-1) 

## Proposition 4
Let x be an element in gorup G - x^0 = e
x^(m+n) = x^m * x^n

## Order
Order of (G, *) is cardinality of its underlying set, denoted |G|

Oder of (G, *):
- number of elements
- smallest numer in G ^ order = e (e.g in Z8: 1 ^ 8 = 0 -> order = 8)

# SubGroup
H be subgroup of G iff
- same e
- h1, h2 $\in$ H -> h1 * h2 $\in$ H
- h $\in$ H -> h^(-1) $\in$ H

trivial subgroup of G: H = {e}

## Preposition 1
H and K be subgroup of G, H $\cap$ K is also subgroup of G

# Cyclic Group
|G| = number of elements in G

generator g: g^n = g * g * g.....g for some n

g must be in G

denote: G = <a> or (a)

## Preposition 1
every cyclic group is abelian
