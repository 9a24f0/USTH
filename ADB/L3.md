# Transaction
- Def'n: sequence of tasks executed as a whole, taking consistent DB state -> another consistent DB state
- Purpose: ensuring integrity and consistency of data
- Properties:
  - atomicity: all statement/none statement must be run
  - consistency: not accept tasks that 1/2 done
  - isolation: transaction runs alone
  - durability: mod are permanent

## Isolation
- user transaction are exec as if they were the only connected users to the DB
- Concurrent exec of many diff transactions submitted by various users must be organized so that each transaction does not interfere with others and produces incorrect results
- level:
  - read uncommited
  - read commited
  - repeatale reads
  - serializable
- use: `SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL ...`

# Lock
- protect row from being affected by another transaction
- properties
  - granuality: size of the lock
  - mode: type of the lock
  - duration: isolation mode of the lock

## Granuality
### DB-level locking
- good for batch processing
- T1 and T2 can't access same DB even on diff tables

### Table-level locking
- can cause bottlenecks when many transactions are trying to acces same table
- T1 and T2 can access same DB as they use diff tables

### Page-level locking
### Row-level locking

## Mode
### Exclusive lock
- only transaction that lock can access
- for update
- not compatible with any

### Shared lock
- read access are granted
- for read-only
- compatible with all except exclusive

## Deadlock
A hold lock on Customer and need lock on Order to finish, while B hold lock on Order and need lock on Customer to finish

Solution:
- choose victim
- rollback victim transaction and redo

Customize lock time out: SET LOCK_TIME OUT func

How to minimize deadlocks:
- access obj in same order
- keep transaction short
- use low iso level
- use bound connexion

# Log and recovery
- purpose: bring DB -> consistent state after failure
- tech: deferred-write and write-through

## Transaction log
components:
- rec of beginning transaction
- for ea transaction component
  - type: UPDATE, DELETE, INSERT
  - table name
  - value before/after
  - pointer previous and next transaction log
- ending commit

## Deferred-write
trancstion operations dont immediately update phys DB, only log is updated, when reach commit point -> DB is update

## Write-through
immediately update transaction operations, if abort, ROLLBACK is performed. 

## Checkpoint
to prevent restart from begining of log

imple restart:
- scan log forward from last checkpoint
- redo all update records

# Schedule
- Serial: ordered one after other
- Nonserial: many possible orders
- Serializability: det correctness of schedules
