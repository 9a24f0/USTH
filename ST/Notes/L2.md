# Testing
Evaluating SW by observing the failures

# Test failure:
Execution of a test the result in a software failure

# Debugging
Finding the fault in given observable failures
 
# Fault & Failure model (RIPR)
- Reachability: location of the fault must be reachable<br>
Example:
``` C
int add (int a, int b)
	if (5 > 0) return a + b;
	else return (a - b)/0;
```
the lower branch which contains div by 0 is not reachable
- Infection: state of programme must be incorrect
- Propagation: The incorrect statement must propagate through the programme
- Reveal: Observable incorrect portion

```

# Software testing activities
- Test engineer: IT professtional who incharge of test activities
- Test manager: Incharge of test engineers

# Testing levels
- Unit
- Module
- Integration
- System
- Acceptance: same as system, but tester are user/customer

# OO Testing level
- Intra-method ~ Unit test
- Inter-method ~ Module test
- Intra-class ~ Integration
- Inter-class ~ System

# Coverage criteria
## Why?
There are too many inputs to test them all

Thus, find fewest inputs that will reveal most problems

2 key problems:
- how do we search?
- when do we stop?

**Coverage criteria** gives structured, pratical ways to search input space.

# What?
- Input domains
- Graphs
- Logic expression
- Syntax description

## How?
### Test requirements
- Test criterion
- Test requirements

### Testing techniks
#### Old
- Black-box
- White-box
- Model-based

#### Model-driven

# Model-driven test design (MDTD)
## Test activites
1. Test design
	- criteria-based test design: creating abstract models and manipulate them to design high-quality test, required knowledge in DM, programming and testing
	- human-based test design: find stress tests (extreme value) and consider actions users might do
2. Test automation
	- Def'n: embedding test values into executable scripts
3. Test execution
	- Def'n: run tests on software and record result
4. Test evaluation
	- Def'n: evaluating the result of testing and report to devs
