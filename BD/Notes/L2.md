# Data Model
Mathematical representation of data
- relation model = tables
- semi-structured model = trees/graphs

Model:
- structure of data
- operations on data
- constraints

# Structure of relation model
Def'n: reational models ~ 2D table: represent data

E.g: 
| title | year | length | genre  |
|-------|------|--------|--------|
| GWTW  | 1939 | 234    | drama  |
| SW    | 1977 | 124    | sciFi  |
| WW    | 1992 | 95     | comedy |

- **Atributes**: column
- **Tuple**: Row
- **Domain**: Each element in tuple must be elementary type
- **Relation**: bag of tuple, not LIST (order is not important)

## Relation instances
Reltion ab Movies is NOT static:
  - insert new movie
  - edit info of existed movie
  - delete existed movie

## Key of relations
set of attributes that is unik
E.g: People(ID, name, address)
-> ID must be key of relation

## Schemas

### Relation schema:
- name
- attributes
- keys
E.g: Movies(*ID*, title, year, length, genre)

### Database schema (set of rel schema)
E.g: 
- Movies(*ID*, title, year, length, genre)
- Producers(name, address, country)

# Operations of relation model

## Relation algebra (RA)
- Operands: 
  - var
  - const
- Operations: woks with relations to create new relation

## Primitive operations
- SELECTION
- PROJECTION
- CARTESIAN PRODUCT
- SET UNION
- SET DIFFERENCE
- RENAME

### Bag Uninon

### Bag Diff: -

### Bag Intersection

### Projection: \pi
eliminate duplicate tuples if any.

### Selection: \delta

### Renaming: \rho

### Cross Product: x

### Join
- Theta-join (R3 := R1 * R2)
    - R' = R1 x R2
    - apply selections to the result
- Natural join
- Inner join
- Outer join

# Complex expression
Combined operations

## Precedence (thứ tự ưu tiên)
- selection, projection, renaming
- cross product, join
- intersec
- union, diff

## Expression Trees

# Constrains
constraint is a relatoinship among data elements that DBMS is required to enforce

## Key of a relation
set A = {A_i} is key if
- A determines all other attr
- no subset of A det all other attri (minimal)

E.g AccademicResults (*StudentID*, *SubjectID*, grade, comment)

### Key types
- Super: attr uniquely iden tuple
- Candidate: mininal super
- Primary: selected from candidate
- Alternate: !primary
- Foreign: attr refers -> PK of another relation
