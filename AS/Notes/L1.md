# Intro

__Algebra__: reunion of broken parts

- study: manipulating symbols
- includes : groups, rings, field
- e.g: numerical methods, image processing, machine learning, etc
- helps: think logically, break down problems

__Application__:

- value: T/F (1/0)
- function: _AND_ (conjunction), _OR_(disjunction), _NOT_(negation)
- Cryptography: sending - receiving secret message

__Theory__: remove noises! (E.g: sending x3 times)

# Terminology

__Statement__: either TRUE or FALSE

__Mathematical proof__: h and p

__Definition__: precise and unambigous description of terms.

__Axiom__: Tiên đề

__Theorem__: proved my mathematical reasoning.

__Lemma__:

__Propostion__:

# Number system

## 1. Real Numbers

### Addition:

- commutative: a + b = b + a
- associative: a + (b + c) = (a + b) + c
- identity: 0 

### Multiplication:

- commutative:
- associative:
- identity: 1

### Order: ```a > b or a < b or a = b```

### Completeness axiom:

e.g: in N, from 1 -> 2, there exist gap
in R, no gap! -> fulfilled every gap between 2 values

## 2. Complex numbers

!Order

## 3. Rational numbers

!compleness order

## 4. Integers

!multiplication, !completeness

## Cayley table:

``` Z5
        |       1       2       3       4
--------+--------------------------------
1       |       1       2       3       4
2       |       2       4       1       3
3       |       3       1       4       2
4       |       4       3       2       1
```

# Function
process: associates x -> y

e.g:

domain X = {1, 2, 3}, codomain Y = {A, B, C, D}

f: X -> Y defined as: {(1, D), (2, C), (3, C)}

## Injective (one-to-one)
distinc element in domain maps to distinc element in codomain

## Surjective (onto)
exist at least one x in X such that f(x) = y for every y in codomain
